# Scientific Ballooning

I led superpressure ballooning efforts at
Bristol SEDS for two years, with 20
launches and over 200 cumulative days of flight.


* Low Cost Superpressure (less than $100 / envelope).
* Talk at the UKHAS Conference 2016:
[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQJAjDEq5AA&t=5h03m16s),
[Slides](https://github.com/richardeoin/a-quick-guide).
* Longest superpressure flight with a primary battery
(UBSEDS14).
* 157-day flight (Amateur record at the time)
(UBSEDS18).
* Live imagery of a superpressure envelope in flight
(UBSEDS20).

# Electronics

I have designed numerous balloon payloads to operate reliably in the harsh enviroment of the Stratosphere.

More generally, my competencies are:

* Electronics design for limited mass, limited power and extreme temperatures.
* Narrow-band radio for Telemetry, Tracking and Imagery.
* Embedded Systems (C, Python, Rust).
* PCB Design (KiCad, Eagle).
